title: "First Docs - Git & GitHub"
---

This semester will be the first that I'll be using and teaching git in my courses, so the first few documents that I've added to the site are focused on the setup and use of git.  While there are already a lot of resources available, many of my students are just getting started with programming and some are beginning computer users.  Because of that, these docs aim to make very few assumptions on what someone may already know. 

I've found the GitHub Education [Classroom Guide](https://education.github.com/guide) information to be extremely helpful.  I was rather unsure how to go about setting all of this up for students and assignments until reading through this.  If you are doing something similar, I highly recommend reading it all the way through.
